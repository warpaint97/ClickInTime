# ClickInTime
This is a Python script `ClickInTime.py` as well as an executable file `ClickInTime/ClickInTime.exe` that allows you to schedule a left mouse click event at a precise time at your current mouse position. The click duration takes approximately 100 ms. A human user would typically hold down the mouse for 40-60 ms for a click.

Additionally there is a Python script `clickTimer.py` that allow you to measure the click duration and the exact time of a click. This script is purely for testing purposes.
