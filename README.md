# ClickInTime
This is a Python script ´ClickInTime.py´ as well as an executable file that allows you to schedule a left mouse click event at a precise time at your current mouse position. The click duration takes approximately 100ms. A human user would typically hold down the mouse for 40-60ms for a click.

Additionally there is a Python script that allow you to measure the click duration and the exact time of a click. This script is purely for testing purposes.
